# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of customer churn using Python. The objective is to identify patterns and key factors that influence customer attrition and propose actionable strategies for improving customer retention.

## Overview

This project explores a telecom customer churn dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA). By identifying patterns and churn drivers, it aims to help businesses improve customer retention strategies using actionable insights and compelling data visualizations.

## Key Insights

- **Churn Rate**: 26.54% of customers have left the company.
- **Senior Citizens**: Churn more frequently than younger customers.
- **Tenure Impact**:
  - Customers with less than two months of tenure are more likely to churn.
  - Long-tenured customers (e.g., 72 months) are generally more loyal.
- **Contract Type**:
  - Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn.
  - Yearly contracts demonstrate stronger customer retention.
- **Services**:
  - Lack of engagement with services like Tech Support or Online Security is associated with higher churn.
- **Payment Method**:
  - Customers using electronic checks churn at a higher rate compared to those using bank transfers or credit cards.
